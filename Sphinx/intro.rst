FPGA Project Description
========================

.. image:: /Research/csueb.png

The architecture that is about to be presented is based on a research project, also on several discussions and available time to be accomplished using a 130nm process.

The goal for this project is creating a functional FPGA starting from its basic components, it will be important for future students to desmistify the technology behind a common used tool.

The FPGA will consist of Soft Logic blocks with Lookup tables having only one tipe of Tile , 1 lenght wires, a channel width of 16 and wilton switch blocks as the "Island-Type" FPGA. 

This project is being developed by the Undergrad student Yang Tavares on California State University, East Bay and is beeing supervised by professor James Tandon from Department of Computer Engineering.
