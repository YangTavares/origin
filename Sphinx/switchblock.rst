The switch block will connect the wires together over the channels in the FPGA making routing possible. We are going to use wilton switch block, it connects to a different wire number at least one time, each wire can connect up to 3 wires (Fs = 3).

The switch block has 3 tri-state buffers for each wire, and there are 2 types of blocks that interconnect the wires, one for output and other for input, since the wires are unidirectional.
