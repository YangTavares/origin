Programming
==================

There are several steps to program the FPGA, first of all is trying to use the less ports as we can to achieve best the use of I/O pads. Also, it is important to have a way to choose which SRAM cells you want to program per time and how to choose then. At the end, use a software to translate your Verilog program into a Place and Route file that will be transformed into our programming logic for the FPGA.
