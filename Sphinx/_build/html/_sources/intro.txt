FPGA Project Description
========================

.. image:: /Research/csueb.png

The architecture that is about to be presented is based on a research project, also on several discussions and available time to be accomplished.

The goal for this project is creating a functional FPGA starting from its basic components, it will be important for future students to desmistify the technology behind a common used tool.

The FPGA will have only one tipe of Tile, 1 lenght wires, a channel width of 16 and wilton switch block. 

This project is being developed by the Undergrad student Yang Tavares on California State University, East Bay and is beeing supervised by professor James Tandon from Department of Computer Engineering.
