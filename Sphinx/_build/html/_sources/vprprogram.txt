Using VPR 
=========

"VPR is a placement and routing tool for array-based FPGAs, and T-VPack is a logic block packing (clustering) program. VPR was written to allow circuits to be placed and routed on a wide variety of FPGAs to facilitate comparisons of different architectures. It takes two input files, a netlist describing the circuit to be placed and routed, and a description of the FPGA architecture. Optionally, one can also input a placement file to VPR if one desires that an existing placement be routed only." - http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~vaughn/vpr/vpr.html
