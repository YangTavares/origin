Interconnect
===================

The FPGA needs a way to connect the Tiles together, the Tiles need to connect to the nearest wires (using connection blocks) , and the end of those wires needs to connect to other wires (using switch blocks). The number of tracks on each channel will be 16 and the wires will be unidirectional.
